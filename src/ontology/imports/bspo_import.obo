comment: In some communities, proximal and distal are used when specifying the position of parts of elements that are contained within the body, such as gill arches or vertebral spines. In these cases, use of the classes medial-lateral axis or medial-external axis are more appropriate.

comment: These anatomical sections are applicable to most bilaterally symmetrical animals, but bipedal animals such as humans have more complex usage of these terms. For example, in post-embryonic humans a coronal plane is vertical and a transverse plane is horizontal, but for embryos and quadrupeds a coronal plane is horizontal and a transverse plane is vertical.

comment: Properly, the ML axis is a half axis; practically, its usage is less clumsy and less linguistically biased than "left-right". The terms may still be used relatively to describe locations along the LR axis. The gills are medial to the operculum, but lateral to the heart.
